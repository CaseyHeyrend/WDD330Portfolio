       <h1>Client-side form validation</h1>
       <p>This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.</p>
       <p>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. 
        If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.</p>
        <h2>What is form validation?</h2>
        <p>Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting. You'll get messages such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).</li>
            <li>"Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).</li>
            <li>"Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).</li>
            <li>"Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data format is required for your data).</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>This is called form validation. 
            When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. 
            Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.</p>
            <p>We want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible. So why do we insist on validating our forms? There are three main reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.</li>
                <li>We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.</li>
                <li>We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application (see Website security).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Different types of client-side validation</h2>
            <p>There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</li>
                <li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
            </ul>
