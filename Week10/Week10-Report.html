        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>I am working with my group and working at challenge two. In addition, I am working on challenge two index and some CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>Do more exercises for Java. I am working on challenge two index and more CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
            <p> Do more exercises for Java. Understand Java and some functions. I think challenge two will be complex. Working with the weather API is hard. I could change my mind.</p>
