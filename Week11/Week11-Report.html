        <p> Do more exercises for Java. I am working on the challenge index, more CSS, and JS.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
            <p>Do more exercises for Java. Understand Java and some functions. I think the challenge is complex. For example, working with the weather API is hard.</p>
