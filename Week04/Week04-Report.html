        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Have a good schedule with my group. 
            We pick a good time and date that we all agree on. 
            I was sick early this week. 
            Not fun. 
            I am better now.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p> Do more exercises for Java. I am trying to understand Github Pages.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>
           Do more exercises for Java. 
           I haven't worked with Java for a long time. 
           I just realized how long. 
           So I hope I am taking the notes with GitHub is right. 
           But I will also put in another link just in case.
