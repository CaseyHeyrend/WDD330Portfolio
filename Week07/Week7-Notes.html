        <h2>Further Functions</h2>
        <h3>Function Properties and Methods</h3>
        <p>The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods themselves.</p>
        <h4>Call and Apply Methods</h4>
        <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.</p>
        <h4>Memoization</h4>
        <p>A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization.</p>
        <p>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. 
           Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again. </p>
        <h3>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h3>
        <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. 
            This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). </p>
        <h3>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h3>
        <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. 
            This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</p>
        <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
        <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved. </p>
        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
        <p>We covered callbacks in Chapter 4. You’ll recall that they’re functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</p>
        <h4>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming</h4>
        <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. 
           JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time. This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking techniques can be used to ensure that the program continues to run. 
           Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that’s invoked when the event happens. </p>
        <h3>Closures</h3>
        <p>Closures are one of JavaScript’s most powerful features, but they can be difficult to get your head around initially.</p>
        <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
        <p>Functional programming has gained momentum in recent years, with a dedicated following. 
            The popularity of purely functional languages, such as Clojure, Scala and Erlang, sparked an interest in functional programming techniques that continues to grow. 
            JavaScript has always supported functional-style programming due to functions being first-class objects. 
            The ability to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use anonymous functions and closures, are all fundamental elements of functional programming that JavaScript excels at.</p>

        <h2>Ajax</h2>
        <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. 
           This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</p>
