        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Meet with my group at our scheduled time. I am studying Java and the code more. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>  Do more exercises for Java. I am trying to understand Github Pages.
Work on the challenge more.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>
           Do more exercises for Java. 
           I am a shy person, and I hate doing code in front of others in a big blocker. 
           Coding in front of others frightens me. 
           But, I know I have to do it at one time. 
           So I hope I am taking the notes with GitHub is right. 
           But I will also put in another link just in case.
