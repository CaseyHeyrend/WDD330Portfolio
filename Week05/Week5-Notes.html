     <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
     <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. 
         A ninja programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to identify and deal with them quickly</p>
     <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
     <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
         <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
         <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
     </ul>
