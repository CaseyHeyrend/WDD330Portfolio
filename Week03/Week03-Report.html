        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Understand more about Github. 
            I learned more about why I was having trouble with VS Code and Github. 
            For example, I didn't have git installed. I thought I did, but I guess I didn't. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>My group has worked out a time to meet out or sometimes close to it.
Take more notes and some java code with it. Have Github and VS Code work together.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>
            One of the blockers for this week would be I didn't have git install, but this (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tn58KQvWtU">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2EM-gkEs0">Part 2</a>. 
            It helped me understand what I was doing wrong. 
           I hope I am taking the notes with GitHub is right. 
           But I will also put in another link just in case.
