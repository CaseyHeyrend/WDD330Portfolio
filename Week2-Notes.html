    <h1>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition</h1>

        <h2>Programming Basics</h2>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript there are two types of comment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single line comments starting with // and finishing at the end of the line</li>
            <li>Multi-line comments starting with /* and finishing with */</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>JavaScript Grammar</h3>
        <p>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with the C programming language.
           A JavaScript program is made up of a series of statements. Each statement ends with a new line or semicolon.
        </p>
        <p>There’s no need to actually use a semicolon to terminate a statement because JavaScript interpreters use a process called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). 
            This will attempt to place semicolons at the end of lines for you. 
            However, it can be error-prone and cause a number of automated services such as code minifiers and validators to not work properly.
        </p>
        <h3>Reserved Words</h3>
        <p>The following words are reserved for use by the JavaScript language and cannot be used to name variables (or function parameters and object properties that appear in later chapters):
        abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
        </p>
        <p>These words are reserved because many of them are used by the language itself, and you will come across them later in this book.
Some of the reserved words are not used by the language, however; one can only assume they were planned to be used at some point, but never were. 
There are also a few words not reserved but really should have been, as they are an important part of the language:
      undefined, NaN, Infinity  
        </p>
        <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>Null</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Any value that isn’t one of the primitive data types listed above is an object. These include arrays, functions and object literals, which will be discussed in later chapters.
         JavaScript has a special operator called <strong>typeof</strong> for finding out the type of a value.
        </p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.</p>
        <h4>Declaring and Assigning</h4>
        <p>Variables have to be declared before they can be used. 
            From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables. 
            The keyword <strong>const</strong> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas <strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.
        To assign a value to a constant or variable, we use the = operator.

        <h2>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair of square brackets:</p>
        <p>const myArray = []; << []</p>
        <h4>Initializing an Array</h4>
        <p>We can create an empty array literal called <strong>heroes</strong> with the following code:</p>
        <p>const heroes = [];</p>
        <p>To access a specific value in an array, we write its position in the array in square brackets (this is known as its index). 
           If an element in an array is empty, undefined is returned.</p>
        <h4>Adding Values to Arrays</h4>
        <p>To place the string 'Superman' inside the first element of our heroes array, we can assign it to element 0, like so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>heroes[0] = 'Superman';</li>
            <li>heroes[0] = 'Batman';</li>
            <li>heroes[1] = 'Wonder Woman';</li>
            <li>heroes[2] = 'Flash';</li>
            <li>heroes[5] = 'Aquaman';</li>
        </ul>
        <p>heroes;<< ['Batman', 'Wonder Woman', 'Flash', undefined, undefined, 'Aquaman']</p>
        <p>Here we can see that the sixth item (with an index of 5) has been filled with the string 'Aquaman'. 
            This has made the array longer than it was before, so all the other unused slots in the array are filled by the value undefined.</p>
        <h4>Creating Array Literals</h4>
        <p>We can create an array literal using square brackets that already contain some initial values, so there’s no need to add each value one by one. 
            Here's an example:</p>
        <p>const avengers = ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk'];
           << ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk']</p>
        <p>You don’t even have to use the same types of items inside an array. 
            This array contains a variety different data types, as well as an empty array object:
        </p>
        <p>const mixedArray = [ null, 1, [], 'two', true ];</p>
        <h4>Removing Values from Arrays</h4>
        <p>The <strong>delete</strong> operator will remove an item from an array:</p>

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <h3>Defining a Function</h3>
        <p>There are a number of ways to define a function in JavaScript. Three of the most common are covered below. 
            ES6 introduced a new way to define functions, using what is known as 'arrow' notation.</p>
        <h4>Function Declarations</h4>
        <p>To define a function literal we can use a <strong>function</strong> declaration:</p>
        <p>function hello(){
        console.log('Hello World!');
        }
        </p>
        <p>This starts with the function keyword and is followed by the name of the <strong>function</strong>, which in this case is called ' <strong>hello</strong> ', followed by parentheses. 
            Following this is a block that contains the code for the function.</p>
        <h4>Function Expressions</h4>
        <p>Another way of defining a function literal is to create a function expression. This assigns an anonymous function to a variable:</p>
        <p>const goodbye = function(){
           console.log('Goodbye World!');
}          };
        </p>
        <h4>Function() Constructors</h4>
        <p>A function can also be declared using the constructor <strong>Function()</strong>. 
            The body of the function is entered as a string, as shown in this example:</p>
        <p>const hi = new Function('console.log("Hi World!");');</p>
        <p>It's not recommended to declare functions in this way as there are numerous problems associated with placing the function body inside a string. 
            Even in this simple example, we had to use different quotation marks for the console.log method, as those used for defining the function body itself. 
            Functions created this way are also created in the global scope, regardless of where they are actually declared. 
            This can lead to some strange and unexpected behavior.</p>
