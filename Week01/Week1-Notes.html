    <h1>Syllabus</h1>
    <h4><a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/174510/assignments/syllabus">Syllabus</a></h4>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This class has an unusual course design. 
            It is designed to use repetition to help you learn efficiently in an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer. 
            Using , HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript you will explore technologies and use them to resolve problems that arise naturally.</p>
        <h3>Exploration Phases</h3>
        <p>These are given to you as a space to start becoming familiar with the programming concepts you learn in this class. 
            The concepts are explained in detail in the required books. 
            Working examples are also found in the required books. Get them all working and understood.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>These are ideas for programs that you come up with. 
            Find a problem in an area you have some level of expertise and solve it using the programming concepts you learned during the exploration phase. 
            The purpose of the challenges is to help you deeply explore the programming concepts you learned in the exploration phases. 
            These are enrichment activities, not initial learning activities. 
            The initial learning activities consist of getting the examples in the books working and understood.</p>

			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<p>Programming is about making computers do what you want. 
                            A computer program is basically a series of instructions that tell your computer how to perform a task.</p>
			<p>The first computer programs were written in<strong> machine code</strong> and<strong> assembly language</strong>. These are low-level programming languages that are closely associated with a computer’s hardware. This means they can be difficult languages to program in because they involve writing abstract code that is heavily tied to a computer’s architecture. If speed is very important, however, then writing in machine code or assembly language can be the best option.</p>
			<p><strong>High-level programming languages</strong>, on the other hand, allow abstractions to be used that make the code easier for humans to read and write. Programs are written in a language such as C, C++ or Java, which is then compiled into machine code and executed. The programs written using these languages are very fast, making high-level languages suited to writing games and professional business software where speed is important. Most native apps are also written in higher-level languages.</p>
			<p><strong>Scripting languages</strong> are also high-level, but they are interpreted, which means they are translated into machine code at run time. This often makes them slower than compiled languages, although interpreters are becoming ever more sophisticated, and increasingly blurring the lines between compiled and interpreted languages.</p>

			<h2>JavaScript</h2>
			<p>The language we’ll be learning in this book is JavaScript, often referred to as the language of the web.</p>
			<p>Nearly all web browsers can run JavaScript, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It has a low barrier to entry ― all you need to program in JavaScript is a text editor and a web browser. Although it is easy to get started, JavaScript can be a tricky language to grasp as it has some unique features and interesting quirks.</p>
			<p> JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that is interpreted and compiled at run time. This means it requires an engine that's responsible for interpreting a program and running it. The most common JavaScript engines are found in browsers such as Firefox, Chrome or Safari, although JavaScript can be run without a browser using an engine such as Google V8. Many modern JavaScript engines use a Just-In-Time (JIT) interpreting process, which considerably speeds up the compilation, making programs run faster.</p>

			<h2>The History of JavaScript</h2>
			<p>The World Wide Web started life as a bunch of pages linked by hyperlinks. Users soon wanted more interaction with these pages, so Netscape (an early browser vendor) asked one of their employees, Brendan Eich, to develop a new language for their Navigator browser. This needed to be done quickly because of the intense competition between Netscape and Microsoft at the time.</p>
			<p>Eich managed to create a prototype scripting language in just 10 days. To do this, he borrowed various elements from other languages, including AWK, Java, Perl, Scheme, HyperTalk and Self. This was an impressive feat, but in the rush to be first to market, a number of quirks and bugs ended up in the language that were never fully addressed.</p>
			<p>The new language was originally called Mocha, but it was changed to LiveScript, then hastily rebranded as JavaScript so it could benefit from the publicity that Sun Microsystem’s Java language was attracting at the time. This name has often caused some confusion, with JavaScript often considered a lighter version of Java. However, the two languages are unrelated ― though JavaScript does have syntactical similarities to Java.</p>

			<h2>The Browser Wars</h2>
			<p>By the time Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4 were released, JavaScript had become incredibly popular. Microsoft had started a lot of hype about the term Dynamic HTML, or DHTML for short, to refer to the use of JavaScript to make HTML more interactive and dynamic. In an attempt to capitalize on this popularity, Netscape and Microsoft tried to add new proprietary features, which lead to different syntaxes being used. This 'arms race' of adding new features became known as the 'Browser Wars'. The unfortunate downside was that programmers had to write two versions of code to achieve the same results in each browser. Professional programmers often dismissed JavaScript as a toy language, unsuitable for any serious programming, but this was unfair criticism ― the language wasn’t the problem, it was the way it was being used.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Microsoft won the browser wars and Internet Explorer emerged as the dominant browser. Support for standards also increased, helped largely by the efforts of the Web Standards Project (WaSP). Developer and browser vendors started to work together and embrace the standards laid out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and ECMA.</p>
			<p>The open-source web browser, Firefox, debuted in 2002, and Apple launched the Safari browser in 2003. Both had strong standards support, which meant developers were able to produce better web applications using JavaScript that behaved consistently across different browsers.</p>

			<h2>Web 2.0</h2>
			<p>In 2005, sites such as Google Maps, Flickr and Gmail started to appear, and demonstrated that JavaScript was capable of creating rich internet applications that looked and behaved like native desktop applications. At around the same time, the term Ajax, short for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, was coined by Jesse James Garrett. This described a technique of obtaining data from a server in the background and updating only the relevant parts of the web page without the need for a full page reload, enabling users to continue interacting with the rest of the page. </p>

			<h2>Standards</h2>
			<p>There has also been competition to increase the speed of the JavaScript engine that is built into the different browsers. This started in 2008 when engineers at Google developed the V8 engine to run inside the Chrome browser. It was significantly faster than previous JavaScript engines, and signaled another arms race as other browser vendors responded by increasing the speed of their engines.</p>

			<h2>HTML5</h2>
			<p>HTML5 is the latest HTML specification, though it’s actually more of an umbrella term for all the latest technologies that are used on the web. This includes HTML, CSS3 and lots of APIs that use JavaScript to interact with web pages. </p>
		</article>

			<h2>Node.js</h2>
			<p>In 2009, Ryan Dahl developed Node.js (commonly known as just Node), which allowed server-side applications to be written in JavaScript. Node is based on Google's V8 engine and allows the creation of fast and powerful real-time web applications written exclusively in JavaScript. It also lead to many applications and JavaScript libraries that don’t use the browser at all. Node.js has proven to be exceptionally popular, and its usage continues to grow. This has increased the interest in and use of JavaScript as it starts to appear in many environments outside the web.</p>

			<h2>JavaScript Versions</h2>
			<p>In 1996, Netscape and Sun Microsystems decided to standardize the language, along with the help of the European Computer Manufacturers Association, who would host the standard. This standardized language was called ECMAScript to avoid infringing on Sun’s Java trademark. This caused even more confusion, but eventually ECMAScript was used to refer to the specification, and JavaScript was (and still is) used to refer to the language itself.</p>
			<p>The working group in charge of maintaining ECMAScript is known as<strong> Technical Committee 39</strong>, or TC-39. It’s made up of representatives from all the major browser vendors such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla, as well as invited experts and delegates from other companies with an interest in the development of the web. They have regular meetings to decide on how the language will develop.</p>
			<p>In 2015, TC-39 decided to adopt a new approach and start publishing a new specification every year, with the version named after the year it was published. This meant that only the features that had been approved would make it into the specification for that year. As a result, ECMAScript version 6 was renamed ECMAScript 2015 when it was published in June 2015 and it added some major new features to the language.</p>

			<h2>The Future of JavaScript</h2>
			<p>These are exciting times for JavaScript as it’s used for more and more applications beyond simply making web pages interactive. There’s been a huge rise in the use of Single Page Applications (SPAs), which run in the browser and rely heavily on JavaScript. </p>

    <h2>The localStorage Object</h2>
    <h4><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">What is HTML Web Storage?</a></h4>
    <p>The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. 
       The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.</p>
