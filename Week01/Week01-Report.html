        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Nothing, since this is my first meeting. Maybe next week I will have the correct answer.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>I am working on taking more notes. Do more exercises for Java.
        Trying to install Node.js and get it to work right.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>
           I am installing Node.js and getting it to work. Understanding Github is also there. 
           I hope I am taking the notes with GitHub is right. But I will also put in another link just in case.
