        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Understand some of Github and fix it to a page. Then, we got a group, and sometime in the week, we met up with my group.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>Understanding Github Pages is high, but I am confused with them. 
            Do more exercises for Java. 
            I am trying to understand Github Pages and get it to work right.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
        <p>
           Understanding Github Pages is high, but I am confused with them. 
           So I am also linking the two pages together. 
           I haven't figured that yet. 
           I hope I am taking the notes with GitHub is right. 
           But I will also put in another link just in case.
