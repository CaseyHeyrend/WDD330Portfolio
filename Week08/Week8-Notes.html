    <h1>HTML5 & CSS3 for the real world: 2nd Edition</h1>

        <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <p>Our page is fairly static. Actually, it’s completely static. In Chapter 4 we learned a little about how to alter a form’s appearance based on its state with the :invalid and :valid pseudo-classes. 
            But what about really moving things around? What about changing the appearance of elements, such as rotating or skewing them?</p>
        <h3>Transforms</h3>
        <p>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
            While some of these effects were possible using previously existing CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.</p>
        <h3>Transitions</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <h3>Moving On</h3>
        <p>With transforms, transitions, and animations, our site is looking more dynamic. 
            Remember the old maxim, though: just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. 
            Animations were aplenty on the Web in the late 90s; a lot of us remember flashing banners and scrolling marquees, and animated gifs were less entertaining than those that are popular today. 
            Use animations and transitions where it makes sense, enhancing the user experience—and skip it everywhere else.</p>

        <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
        <p>The HTML5 Herald is becoming quite dynamic for an “ol’ timey” newspaper! We’ve added a video with the new video element, made our site available offline, added support to remember the user’s name and email address, and used geolocation to detect where our user is.</p>
        <h3>Canvas</h3>
        <p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. 
            This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network.
            With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.</p>
