        <h1>Answer Three questions</h1>
        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>I am working with my group and looking at challenge two.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p>Do more exercises for Java. Also, I am cleaning up my Index CSS more. Also, work on challenge two.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
            <p>
                Do more exercises for Java. Understand Java and some functions. 
                I think challenge two will be complex. I don't know what challenge two will be in the end. 
                I could change my mind.
