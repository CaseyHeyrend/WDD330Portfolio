        <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
        <p>Work with my group for the last time, and we didn't meet at the right scheduled time. 
            So on Thursdays is our meeting time and we meet on Friday. 
            In addition, I am working on the challenge index, some CSS, and JS.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
        <p> Do more exercises for Java. I am working on the challenge index, more CSS, and JS.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
            <p>Do more exercises for Java. Understand Java and some functions. I think the challenge is complex. </p>
